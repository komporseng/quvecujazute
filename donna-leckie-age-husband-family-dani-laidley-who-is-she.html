After hearing that Dani was one of Australia’s top 100 women, online users of social media reacted immediately. The whole list will be shown in MAXIM Australia’s November 2023 edition. Margot Robbie, who plays Barbie, shared the top slot with Dani, while other notables like Sam Kerr, Sophie Monk, and others also made the cut.</p><p>So, find out more about her partner in this piece below. Here we discuss her age, husband, family, and more.</p><h3><strong>Meet Donna Leckie, Dani Laidley Partner</strong></h3><p>Dani Laidley has a partner named Donna Leckie. The couple are reportedly a childhood sweetheart. DailyMail reported in September 2023 that the couple might be engaged as Dani hinted about their engagement. In 2021, the pair, who had been childhood sweethearts in elementary and high school, resumed their romance after reconnecting in 2017.</p><p><i>The Herald Sun </i>has since revealed the pair first met in Grade 1 at a Western Australian primary school in 1973.</p><p>The former AFL superstar claimed that the women wear matching rings but did not elaborate on their significance while speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Monday at the Melbourne premiere of her Stan Original documentary, Revealed – Danielle Laidley: Two Tribes.</p><p>“You can take our rings for whatever you wish to take them for,” Dani said coyly. “We haven’t spoken to our family, and if anything was ever going to happen we would speak to them first. Particularly our boys.”</p><p>Dani previously addressed the rumors of an engagement in 2022 when she raised eyebrows by donning a diamond ring.</p><p>Dani was seen in a video raising her hand to her face in shock when the ring caught the light, which was shot at Moonee Ponds, Victoria, and posted at the time to Instagram. She appeared to be out and about at a restaurant in the video, and she frequently caught sight of the ring. Adding to the mystery, the video was captioned: “What has just happened? Oh my god.”</p><p>Dani denied the rumors at the time, telling Daily Mail Australia, “We aren’t getting married and we aren’t engaged.”</p><p>“We have had the best time in lockdown, playing UNO and being silly, we have known each other our whole lives so it was just fun,” Donna gushed to Daily Mail Australia that year. In November 2021, Dani went out for the first time with Donna, her childhood sweetheart, and the girl she sat next to in first grade. Additionally, she honored her new partner by donning earrings that had the letter “D” in her name.</p><p>Donna is also a proud mother and grandmother. One of the many reasons why Dani has advanced so far in her private life is because of Donna’s presence. “It’s been tough at times. But I feel I am a much more rounded person,” Laidley said last. “I feel that I can let myself love and be loved now, instead of self-sabotaging in lots of different ways from an early age, right up until 18 months ago.”</p><h3><strong>Did Donna Leckie Have A Husband?</strong></h3><p>Details regarding Donna Leckie’s husband are currently not available.</p><p>But we know about her children. She is a mom to at least one son named Jace Leckie. Jace is married to his wife Kaity Leckie. The pair exchanged vows in August 2018.</p><p>Jace is originally from <span class=xt0psk2>Mandurah, Western Australia. Kaity is from Portland, Oregon.</span></p><p>They are parents to one daughter Dylan Marie.</p><h3><strong>Donna Leckie Age</strong></h3><p>In February 2023, Donna Leckie turned 56 years old.</p><h3><strong>Donna Leckie Family</strong></h3>Although Donna Leckie has featured her dad, it is not who her family members are.<h3><strong>Donna Leckie Job</strong></h3><p>Donna Leckie is a highly regarded aged care specialist with more than two decades of experience. She also juggles her vocation as chief operations officer at Compatible Care.</p><p>On her Facebook, Donna Leckie revealed that she is the owner/director at SIL Care Pty Ltd.</p><p>“Having managed care for the past 30 years and a family member requiring assistance in a Supported Independent Living home, we wanted to create an environment like no other. Seeing firsthand the gaps in accessing suitable accommodation that catered to our families’ needs. Consulting with NDIS participants about what’s important to them to lead a purposeful and safe life in a supportive environment where choice is everything. The participant is at the center of everything with decision-making, choice and control, social activities, and more. All the while having the support of dedicated staff 24/7 to work together with the person. Our management team has a unique and diverse background to ensure the culture for both participants and staff is warm and welcoming, where we all work together. We all had a dream of creating homes where NDIS participants could live their best life and SIL Care was born”</p><p>Donna was a former Operation Manager at <span class=xt0psk2>Amana Living.
