It was meant to be an example for parents everywhere of the ideal template for the “superior race.”</p><p>Little did they know, the girl was actually Jewish.</p><p>The photographer, Hans Ballin of Berlin, originally snapped the image in late 1934 as a standard baby photo for Taft’s parents to keep. But then, he secretly submitted her photo to the magazine’s Aryan beauty contest — and she won.</p><p>But Hessy Levinsons Taft’s incredible story doesn’t end there. In 1990, she detailed her entire journey for the <a href=#>United States Holocaust Museum</a>.</p><p>The story begins when Taft’s parents, Jacob and Pauline Levinsons, came to Berlin in 1928 — just a few years before Hitler took power.</p><p>The young couple, who were both Latvian Jews, dreamed of becoming famous singers. But with anti-Semitism on the rise, they couldn’t get work. Broke and living in a tiny apartment, they gave birth to their soon-to-be-famous daughter on May 17, 1934.</p><p>“My mother took me to a photographer, one of the best in Berlin!” Taft recounted. “And he did — he made a very beautiful picture — which my parents thought was very beautiful.”</p><p>The proud parents propped the photo up on display in their home. They were understandably surprised when, a short time later, one visitor said she recognized it from a magazine.</p><p>In disbelief, Pauline asked the woman to buy her a copy. And sure enough, there was her daughter’s face on the cover.</p><p>Horrified to see their baby girl on the cover of a prominent Nazi magazine, they called Ballin. He told the frantic Pauline to calm down.</p><p>“I will tell you the following,” Taft says he told her mother. “I was asked to submit my 10 best pictures for a beauty contest run by the Nazis. So were 10 other outstanding photographers in Germany. So 10 photographers submitted their 10 best pictures. And I sent in your baby’s picture.”</p><p>They were trying, he went on, to find the “perfect example of the Aryan race to further Nazi philosophy.”</p><p>Pauline was still confused. Ballin had been well aware that Taft was Jewish.</p><p>“Yes,” he agreed. “I wanted to allow myself the pleasure of this joke. And you see, I was right. Of all the babies, they picked this baby as the perfect Aryan.”</p><p>“I wanted to make the Nazis ridiculous,” Ballin said.</p><p>The photo continued to spread and the family took a secret pleasure in the irony of it. For Taft’s first birthday, her aunt even bought her a card with her own face on it.</p><p>Taft settled in the United States in the late 1940s. She went on to get married and become a chemistry professor at St. John’s University in New York. Now 83, she’s still on the university’s faculty.</p><p>Eventually, Taft’s family fled to Cuba, where they were faced with another dictator.</p><p>“‘I have survived Hitler; I will survive Castro,'” Taft remembers her father saying. “And he did. He did.”</p><p>In 2014, Taft presented the original magazine cover that her mother had bought to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Israel.</p><p>“I can laugh about it now,” she said. “But if the Nazis had known who I really was, I wouldn’t be alive.”</p><p>After learning about Hessy Levinsons Taft, the not so perfect Aryan baby, read about <a href=#>Julian Bilecki</a>, the teenager who saved dozens of Jews from Nazi death squads. Then, discover the little-known story of <a href=#>John Rabe and the other Nazis who helped defend Chinese civilians from being massacred by the Japanese just prior to World War II</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonypsdKssGaklau2r7%2FOp6pmrJGbwQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhessy-levinsons-taft.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhessy-levinsons-taft.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhessy-levinsons-taft.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhessy-levinsons-taft.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhessy-levinsons-taft.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhessy-levinsons-taft.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./charlotte-ross.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./charlotte-ross.html>Charlotte Ross Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ricky-rivero-obituary.html>Ricky Rivero Obituary: Honoring The Life Of Remarkable Filmmaker Star</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ricky-rivero-obituary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
