普通にイケメンだという意見もありますが、どちらかという可愛いと言われる声の方が多いですね。
穏やかで優しい印象の藤原聡さんですが、何か「と〜と似てる」と言われる声が多いです。
ネット上ではセカオワの深瀬さん、コロコロチキペッパーの西野創人さん、俳優の濱田岳さんにそっくりとの声があります。
実際にどの部分が似ているのか検証してみたいと思います。
藤原聡の髪型のウェーブはパーマ？セカオワ深瀬の可愛い系 育ちが良くて秀才のイメージがある藤原聡さんですが、見た目も優等生です。
これまでに髪を染めたことはありますが、基本的には黒髪がベーシックですね。
昔は黒髪を真っ直ぐに降ろした髪型が多かったですが、ここ最近は少し伸ばして毛先に流れを作っています。
「可愛い」との声の多い藤原さんですが、確かに髪型も含めて子供っぽく可愛いですね。
髪のウェーブはパーマではなく、アイロンで流れを作って、ワックスやジェルを馴染ませているのだと思います。
もうちょっと長めに伸ばしてがっつりパーマをかけてもカッコ良さそうですね！
藤原聡のピアノ演奏してる横顔がセカオワの深瀬そっくり？ ネット家では藤原聡さんとSEKAI NO OWARIのボーカルの深瀬さんがそっくりだという声があります。
実際に深瀬さんの写真を見てみると、確かに言いたいことは分かります。
色白で目が小さめで可愛げのある笑顔。
藤原さんが深瀬さんぐらいに髪を伸ばして明るい色に染めたら、すごく似てると思います。
藤原さんの横顔に関しては、さらに深瀬さんに似てると思います。
艶やかで強い歌声も系統が近いということで、今後は比較されることも増えそうですね。
経歴的には藤原さんは幸せな家庭で勉強も音楽も努力し、就職し社会の壁にぶつかりながらも切磋琢磨してきたのに対して、深瀬さんは学生時代から闇が多くいかにも現代のロックスターといった感じで、系統的には真逆です。
「結構重めの閉鎖病棟に入ってたんで。入院してて、長い闘病生活をしてた」と心を病んでいたことも暴露。これが理由で、「病気を克服したら、そういう人たちを担当する医者になりたい」と自身と同じ人間を救いたいと考えていたという。
しかし、まともに高校すら行かなかったFukaseに受験勉強は重かったようで、「中卒が医者になる道のりが、登れば登るほど遠すぎて」と結局投げ捨てたことも告白。そこで仲の良かった友人が「『バンドを組んであげないと、この人お先真っ暗すぎる』と情けで組んでくれた」のがすべての始まりだったと言う。
生き方や味わってきたことが音楽にも現れていて、ダークな世界観のセカオワと、爽やかでポップなヒゲダンとは大違いです。
ちなみに深瀬さんの方が藤原さんより大先輩のイメージがありますが、ヒゲダンは下積みが長かったので、実は年齢は大きく変わりません。（深瀬さんが1985年で藤原さんが1991年）
藤原聡の笑顔がコロコロチキンペッパーの西野創人に似てる？ セカオワの深瀬さん以上に似てると言われているのがお笑い芸人・コロコロチキンペッパーの西野創人です。
確かに雰囲気と髪型がそっくりです。
しかしながら、輪郭の雰囲気はちょっと違うかと。
コロチキの西野さんも女性ファンが多いです。芸人らしからぬ爽やかな笑顔が可愛いと人気のようです。
相方のナダルさんがあの感じなので、余計に西野さんがスッキリした印象に見えますもんね。
ただ西野さんもなかなかの曲者で、過去にバラエディー番組で同級生の女の子に取材をした際には、絶対に共演したくないと拒絶されていました。
続いて番組では、西野が中学時代に好意を抱いていた同級生8人をピックアップ。その過程で西野が当時、学校の裏ボス的な存在であった同級生、リョウタロウさんとの間に“黒歴史”を抱えていたことが発覚する。「授業中に紙が回ってきて、校庭で犬のマネをさせられて、それが出来たら何ポイント、みたいな感じで……」と西野。学校ではリョウタロウさんのオモチャ代わりにされており、女子からは非常に嫌われていたという。
当時の8人に連絡をとってもらおうと、リョウタロウさんの力を借りた西野。しかし電話口のリョウタロウさんからは、「8割の連絡先は把握したが、（いずれも）西野がNGらしい」と残酷な事実が告げられる。それを横で聞いていたナダルは「こいつ一切信用されてないで！」と小躍りし、西野に頭をはたかれる。
「（西野のことが）トラウマになってるらしくて」とリョウタロウさん。連絡をとった同級生からは「出演するとしても西野絡みは……」と激しく拒絶されたという。「リョウタロウが考えた企画をやってただけやのに……」とこぼす西野にナダルは「詐欺グループの主犯格と出し子、全部一緒やねん！」と絶妙な例えでツッコみ、スタジオは大爆笑。調査の結果、コロチキの2人はいずれも学生時代に深い闇を抱えていることがわかった。
勉強と音楽を両立し、同級生からも慕われてた藤原聡さんは真逆ですね。
声は濱田岳にそっくり。藤原聡の声の出し方 セカオワの深瀬さん、コロチキの西野さんに続いて似てると言われているのが俳優の濱田岳さんです。
似てると言われてるの見た目ではなくて声質ですね。
これは藤原さんが地上波の番組に出演するたびに、必ず誰かがツイッターなどでつぶやくので気付いてる方は多いかと思います。
低いトーンでちょっと生意気な感じの声の出し方がそっくりです。
ただ、性格はまったく似てないですね。
濱田岳さんの方が図々しくもハキハキした感じですが、藤原さんは礼儀正しくビシッとした感じで可愛げがありますから。
ガードマンにはさすが似てない 人気YouTuberのガードマンと藤原聡さんがそっくりだという声もありますが、これはさすがに似てないと思います。
髪型の雰囲気だけで同カテゴリーに縛りすぎだと思います。
生まれも育ちも性格も似ていません。
唯一の共通点といえば音楽をやっているということですね。ジャンルがまったく違うのでコラボするようなことはないさそうです。
