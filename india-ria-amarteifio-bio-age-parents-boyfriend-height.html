Soon, fans were also assured that they were going to get a prequel too. The spin-off is called Queen Charlotte. It is an eight-part series and is based on a young Queen Charlotte, long before the events of Bridgerton. Taking on the role, as her very first lead role, is young actress India Ria Amarteifio.</p><p>Let us tell you the rest about India‚Äôs career, personal life, and more in this bio.</p><h3><strong>India Ria Amarteifio Age</strong></h3><p>India Ria Amarteifio turned 21 years old in 2021 and not long after she landed her breakthrough role on Netflix after having played supporting characters in shows like Line Of Duty, Sex Education (as Lizzie), and Doctor Who (as the magician‚Äôs apprentice, Alison). She had however still notably played Sophie, the daughter of DCI Roz Huntley in season four of Line Of Duty.</p><p>By the time Bridgerton Season 2 came to us, India‚Äôs much anticipated Queen Charlotte had already begun.</p><p>Not long ago, India outed the news about the new acting job, and wrote on IG ‚ÄúUr, yeah? Yeah. üëë No words really.<br>Thank you to my secret keepers for keeping it a secret. Absolute honor :)‚Äù. Next to her, in the picture was Golda Rosheuvel (of course). Golda played the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in the original Bridgerton.</p><p>The upcoming series follows the young queen‚Äôs love life and her journey from outsider to a position of extreme power. This is going to tell us so much about the way she behaves when she is older. The queen was actually betrothed to the King of England, whom she had never met. Then, when she arrived in London, she was not what anyone expected, especially with her mixed-race heritage. But, she navigates anyway, The Ton, and palace on her own terms. All this and more we shall explore when the show is finally out.</p><p>In the meantime, the makers have promised us that the story will also focus on Violet Bridgerton and Lady Danbury, with actresses Ruth Gemmell and Adjoa Andoh resuming their respective roles.</p><p>Joining them in the show also are young actors Corey Mylchreest as the young King George; Arsema Thomas as the young Agatha Danbury; Michelle Fairley as Princess Augusta; Sam Clemmett as young Brimsley (and a few others).</p><h3><strong>Who Are India Ria Amarteifio Parents?</strong></h3><p>Among so many other things, India Ria Amarteifio had also not revealed to her fans who her parents are, their names, profession, and more.</p><p>But, we somehow learned that these people with the names Nicole Amarteifio and Ben Amarteifio. Nicole, here, hails from and is based in Accra, Ghana. She is a creator at An African City; and studied&nbsp;at Georgetown University and Brandeis University.</p><h3><strong>India Ria Amarteifio Height</strong></h3><p>India Ria Amarteifio stands 5‚Äô6‚Ä≥ tall in height and says she has had difficult experiences loving her natural hair. Of course, over the years she has learned to celebrate those dark brown curls. They are matching to her brown eyes.</p><h3><strong>India Ria Amarteifio Net Worth</strong></h3><p>India&nbsp;reportedly had less than $450K net worth as of April 2022.</p><p>She won a scholarship to the Sylvia Young Theatre School in 2013 and gradually came across the&nbsp;supporting roles in Military Wives, Unforgotten, The Tunnel, and The Evermore Chronicles.</p><h3><strong>Does India Ria Amarteifio Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>So far, India‚Äôs social media profile did not give away anything about her relationship and dating life. Even her interviews were found to be strictly professional. So, it‚Äôs fair to conclude that her private life seemed to have flown under the radar. A low profile and a bit mysterious, only adds to the anticipation. And maybe this way she plans to attract even more attention than she would have if she put everything out there. But then that might change anytime now.</p><p>Or, maybe she is just single and not ready to mingle, and is instead working to get her craft right.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is India Ria Amarteifio Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>The 17th of September is when India celebrates her birthday, and this makes her a Virgo.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is India Ria Amarteifio Ethnicity?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>India Ria Amarteifio likely acquires mixed ethnicity from her parents.
