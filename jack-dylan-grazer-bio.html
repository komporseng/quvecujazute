He’s the co-founder of a clothing brand that supports mental health awareness. He’s Jack Dylan Grazer, and he’s not your typical Hollywood star. At only 12 years old, Jack has already amassed an impressive resume of roles in film and television, working with some of the biggest names in the industry. But he’s not just a talented performer, he’s also a passionate advocate for causes that matter to him, such as disability awarness, LGBTQ+ rights, and anti-bullying. He’s not afraid to speak his mind, share his struggles, and inspire his fans with his positivity and authenticity. In this article, let’s see his personal and professional journey.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jack Dylan Grazer: A Bisexual Star with He/They Pronouns</h2><p>Jack Dylan Grazer, the 17-year-old actor who voiced Alberto in Luca, came out as bisexual during an Instagram Live broadcast in July 2021. He also updated his pronouns to he/they on his Instagram profile. When a fan asked him if he was gay, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">answered</a> with a smile, “I’m bi,” and then quoted his Luca character, who says “Silenzio Bruno!” to silence his inner doubts and fears Grazer’s quote shows his confidence and pride in his sexuality, as well as his connection to his character, who also explores his identity and friendship in the Pixar film.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jack-Dylan-Grazer.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Relationship of Jack Dylan Grazer</h2><p>Jack Dylan Grazer, the young star of It and Shazam, has had a turbulent love life that has often made headlines. The actor, who came out as bisexual in 2021, has been involved with several women, some of whom have been involved in scandals with him. Here is a rundown of his dating history and the controversies that have surrounded it.</p><p>Grazer’s first known girlfriend was Ellie Hiyar, a social media influencer who he dated in 2017. The couple seemed happy and cute together, but their relationship did not last long. They broke up later that year, reportedly due to their busy schedules and Grazer’s rising fame.</p><p>In 2020, Grazer started dating Cylia Chasman, a model and singer who appeared in some of his Instagram posts. Their relationship seemed to be going well until they had a nasty split in 2021. A fan page claimed that Grazer had cheated on Chasman with another woman for four months and had physically and verbally abused her. The fan page alleged that he had thrown a hydro flask at her, slapped her, pulled her hair, and slammed a door on her face. The fan page also said that they had witnesses, videos, and texts to back up their accusations.</p><p>Grazer denied the fan page’s allegations and said that they were false and malicious. He also released a statement from his lawyer, who called Chasman a “troubled, immature, attention-seeking woman” who was trying to ruin his reputation. The lawyer also said that Grazer was considering legal action against the fan page. Grazer’s fans were divided over the issue, with some supporting him and others believing the fan page.</p><p>Around the same time, Grazer came out as bisexual during a live Instagram broadcast, where he said that he used he/they pronouns. He also said that he was proud of who he was and that he hoped his fans would accept him.</p><p>In 2022, Grazer moved on with Morgan Cohen, a TikTok star and model who was six years older than him. They made their relationship official in March 2022, when they posted a video of them on TikTok. They also shared many other PDA-filled videos and photos on social media, showing off their love for each other. However, they also faced backlash from some fans who thought that their age gap was inappropriate and that they were too public with their romance.</p><p>Grazer and Cohen were last seen together in August 2022, when they attended the Venice Film Festival and shared a kiss on the red carpet. Since then, they have not posted anything about each other, leading to speculation that they may have broken up. Neither of them has confirmed or denied their current status.</p><p>Grazer’s romantic life has been full of drama and controversy, but he has also been successful in his acting career. He has starred in several popular films, such as Luca, Ron’s Gone Wrong, and Shazam! Fury of the Gods. He has also voiced characters in animated projects, such as Batman and Superman: Battle of the Super Sons and Dreamin’ Wild.&nbsp;He has a net worth of between $1 million and $5 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio of Jack Dylan Grazer</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=10><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td><strong>Jack Dylan Grazer</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of birth</strong></td><td><strong>September 3, 2003</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Place of birth</strong></td><td><strong>Los Angeles, California, U.S.</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zodiac sign</strong></td><td><strong>Virgo</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pronouns</strong></td><td><strong>He/they</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Occupation</strong></td><td><strong>Actor</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Years active</strong></td><td><strong>2014–present</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Relatives</strong></td><td><strong>Brian Grazer (uncle)</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Breakthrough role</strong></td><td><strong>Eddie Kaspbrak in It (2017) and It Chapter Two (2019)</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Superhero film</strong></td><td><strong>Freddy Freeman in Shazam!
