While he had a fairly successful career as a child actor both in film and on television, his fame rose to new heights when he starred in the adventure film “The Hunger Games” and its sequels. Currently he is working on “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2”, which will appear in the theatres later in 2015.</p><h3>Josh Hutcherson Net Worth $2.5 Million</h3><p>So how did Josh Hutcherson’s involvement with bigger movie titles over the last few years affect his earnings? Sources estimate his current net worth to have reached $2.5 million. Most if not all of it has been accumulated from his work as a movie and television actor.</p><p>Josh Hutcherson’s career as an actor began at a young age – he was nine years old when his parents decided that he should get professional acting lessons, so they decided to move to Hollywood in 2002. As with many Hollywood actors, Josh began his acting career by appearing in TV commercials. He made his first television appearances in TV shows in 2002 – he had small parts in “Becoming Glen”, “House Blend” and “ER”. The first television film that Josh Hutcherson appeared in was Animal Planet’s film “Miracle Dogs” in 2003. Following that, he began starring in feature films as well as continuing to appear in television shows. The first role that brought Josh Hutcherson to the spotlight was him playing a lead role in a romantic comedy “Little Manhattan” (in 2005) for which he received both positive and negative reviews. In the same year, Hutcherson played another lead role in the science fiction adventure movie “Zathura”. For this role he received a Young Artist Award in nomination of “Best Performance in a Feature Film by a Leading Young Actor” which had an influence on his career as an actor as well as his net worth. However, the role which made the biggest impact on his career as a child actor was his role in the fantasy film “Bridge to Terabithia” for which he won another Young Artist Award. This role helped him rise as an actor and in 2011 he landed a role in The Hunger Games films as one of the main characters – Peeta Melark. The first film has been a success, as well as the second (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and the third one (The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1).</p><p>In 2012, for his role of Peeta Melark in “The Hunger Games”, Josh won NewNowNext Award, CinemaCon Award, two MTV Movie Awards (for “Best Fight” and “Best Male Performance”), two Teen Choice Awards and a Do Something Award. This is the most awards Josh has received in his career and “The Hunger Games” movies are obviously greatly responsible for the rise in Josh’s net worth. In 2014 he won a MTV Movie award for “Best Performance” and another Teen Choice Award for his work in “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”.</p><p>In his personal life, Josh Hutcherson is a supporter of LGBT equality, and he’s one of the advocates of the “Straight But Not Narrow” campaign. In 2012, Josh received a Vanguard Award for actively promoting equal rights for people in LGBT community.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjsLC5jqOmrKBdncK1r8eeqaynnmK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjosh-hutcherson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjosh-hutcherson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjosh-hutcherson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjosh-hutcherson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjosh-hutcherson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjosh-hutcherson-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./surnames.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./surnames.html>Last name JEANETTE: origin and meaning</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jeremy-jauncey.html>Jeremy Jauncey- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Career, Girlfriend</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jeremy-jauncey.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
