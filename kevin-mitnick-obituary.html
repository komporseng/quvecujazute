<time>20 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>American computer security expert, author, and convicted hacker Kevin David Mitnick was born on August 6, 1963. His high-profile arrest in 1995 and subsequent five-year prison sentence for several computer and communications-related offenses brought him widespread notoriety.</p><p>Journalism, novels, and movies about Mitnick‚Äôs pursuit, arrest, trial, and sentencing were divisive. Kevin Mitnick passed away on Sunday (16 July). You can read details about Kevin Mitnick‚Äôs obituary in the below section.</p><h2>Kevin Mitnick Obituary</h2><p><strong>Kevin David Mitnick, 59, passed away on Sunday, July 16, 2023</strong>, after a courageous fight against pancreatic c·ºÄncer. Kimberley Mitnick, Kevin‚Äôs devoted wife, survived him by staying by his side for the entirety of their experience. Kimberley is expecting the couple‚Äôs first child together. Kevin was overjoyed to start this next chapter of his life with Kimberley, but their happiness was cut tragically short.</p><p><strong>Below is the tweet provided about Erin Elizabeth about Kevin Mitnick‚Äôs death:</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>It is with very heavy heart üíîthat I announce the death of one of my dearest friends of several decades, computer hacker turned security expert and New York Times best selling author, Kevin Mitnick a.k.a. ‚ÄúFree Kevin‚Äù.</p><p>I have been quiet for several days since our mutual friend‚Ä¶</p><p>‚Äî Erin Elizabeth Health Nut News üôå (@unhealthytruth) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 20, 2023</a></p><p>Kevin‚Äôs grandmother, Reba Vartanian, father, Alan Mitnick, and half-brother, Adam Mitnick, were all gone before he was born. Kevin‚Äôs family includes his stepmother Nanci King, his great aunt Sophie ‚ÄúChickie‚Äù Leventhal and her longtime partner Dr. Bob Berkowitz, and Kevin‚Äôs cousins Mitch Leventhal, Karen van den Berg, Jolie Mitnick, Mark Mitnick, and Wendy Cohen. His brother-in-law Ricky Barry and his wife Roxy also survive him, along with their three children, Millie, Winston, and George.</p><p>Kevin also wishes to thank his many devoted friends, including Michael Morris, Paul Dryman, Roy Eskapa, Shawn Nunley, Darci and Brianna Wood, Amy Gray, Alex Kasper (Kasperavicius), David Kennedy, David Fugate, Dr. Nick Spirtos, Stu Sjouwerman, and Apollo Robbins, for their unwavering friendship and support over the years.</p><p>All of Kevin‚Äôs close buddies would take too long to name here. He was incredibly lucky to have so many. I won‚Äôt even bother naming names. You made a huge impression on Kevin. Kevin was also appreciative of the millions of people around the world who supported the ‚ÄúFREE KEVIN‚Äù movement in the mid-to late-1990s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kevin-Mitnick.webp><p>Kevin was a true original; his life reads like a novel in many respects. Most of us who knew him would use the adjective ‚Äúmagnificent‚Äù to describe him.</p><p>He spent his formative years in California‚Äôs San Fernando Valley, where he developed his prodigious intelligence and restless energy while also developing a healthy distrust of authority and a deep fascination with the mystical arts.</p><p><strong>You can also take a look at other celebrities who have passed recently, their obituaries details are covered below:</strong></p><p>Kevin‚Äôs brilliance and enjoyment of capturing and holding the attention of his audience were clear even in his early years. Pranks and magic tricks gave way to phone phreaking, social engineering, and computer hacking as his interests matured.</p><p>His need to test limits eventually got the better of him, and he spent time in both juvenile detention and adult prison. His time as the world‚Äôs most wanted hacker was chronicled in the New York Times best-selling book The Ghost in the Wires, as well as the books The Art of Deception and The Art of Intrusion, both co-authored with William Simon, and The Art of Invisibility, co-authored with Robert Vamosi.</p><p>To know more details about the obituaries and passing details of the recent trending people you can join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgbHxzfI6knK%2BhnmK6qsDNopqkZZ%2BXtrXBwKuwaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkevin-mitnick-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkevin-mitnick-obituary.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkevin-mitnick-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkevin-mitnick-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkevin-mitnick-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkevin-mitnick-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lori-loughlin.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lori-loughlin.html>Lori Loughlin (Actress) Wiki, Bio, Height, Weight, Age, Net Worth, Scandal, Family, Husband, Daug</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./porn-history.html>What You Should Know About Humanity's Favorite Pastime</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./porn-history.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
