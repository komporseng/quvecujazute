The American actor and producer, known also for playing Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field of Dreams&nbsp;and Tommy Vercetti in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, passed away <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>in his sleep on 26 May 2022 at the age of 67. He is survived by his daughter, Karsen, and his fiancée, Jacy Nittolo.</span></p><p style=text-align:left>Karsen, here, is late Ray’s daughter with ex-wife, actress, and producer, Michelle Grace. And because you are looking to find out more about her, here’s writing telling you just that or even more.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Michelle Grace, Ray Liotta’s Ex-Wife</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Michelle Grace first met Ray Liotta at a baseball game, where her former husband Mark Grace was playing for the Chicago Cubs. They maybe fell for each other around that time before they got married in February 1997. But, IMDB also had it writing that these two met&nbsp;on the set of The Rat Pack in 1998 and that they were married by an Elvis Presley impersonator in Las Vegas. Then again, we have also seen glimpses of their Thailand wedding, and they dressed in St. Pucchi custom design.</p><p style=text-align:left>The year 2004 however saw them divorce and part ways. But, even afterward, according to media outlets, Ray and Michelle only had kind words about each other. Things were easy also because they separated amicably. They were called the “friendly exes”.</p><p style=text-align:left>“Thank God we’re still friends”, Ray once told The Guardian about his ex-wife. He also gushed about how great of a woman she is.</p><p style=text-align:left>Among other things, he liked/respected her when she stayed at his house so that their daughter could see them together. Ray said he and his former wife hoped to give their daughter as much semblance of a family unit as they could.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Michelle Grace And Ray Liotta’s Daughter</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Before divorcing, Michelle Grace and Ray Liotta had a daughter and she is <a href=#>Karsen</a>. And Karsen apparently is the only child of Ray and maybe of Michelle too.</p><p style=text-align:left>Karsen was born sometime in 1988 and as per her IMDB profile, she is an actress, known for Hubie Halloween (2020), Shades of Blue (2016), and Prettyface (2016). It looked like she is following in her late father’s footsteps by taking up acting.</p><p style=text-align:left>Lately, things must have been tough for Karsen, losing a father who loved her so much. Back in the days when he was still alive, Ray had told The Guardian how his whole life is about his daughter. He described how he did not like going too long without seeing her. It was 2007 and he said his life was all about taking Karsen to dance classes and playing with her.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Michelle Grace’s Husband Now</strong></h3><p>As of 2022, it was not clear if Michelle Grace married again since Ray.</p><p>Ray, on the other hand, was happily engaged to Jacy Nittolo until the time of his death. The pair had started dating during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and had gotten engaged on Christmas of that year.</p><p>The only other husband that we know of Michelle is Mark Grace. She was married to him from 5 November 1988 through 1993. And they had no kids together.</p><p>Mark (Eugene) Grace, so you know, is a former Major League Baseball first baseman who spent 16 seasons with the Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks of the National League. He was notably a member of the 2001 World Series champion Diamondbacks that beat the New York Yankees.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Michelle Grace On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Michelle Grace did not seem to be on Instagram or any other social media platforms as of May 2022. And we could also not spot her on her daughter’s Instagram @karsen_liotta, where she entertained 194 posts and 33.2K followers so far.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Michelle Grace Age</strong></h3><p>Michelle Grace was born on 4 December 1968. So, she reached the age of 53 in 2021.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Michelle Grace Job</strong></h3><p>Michelle Grace, according to her IMDB profile, is a producer and actress, known for Narc (2002), Take the Lead (2006), and The Rat Pack (1998). And over the course, she also worked on several projects in which Ray Liotta also starred.</p><p>She was cast in The Rat Pack due to her uncanny resemblance to a young Elizabeth Taylor.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>What Do We Know About Michelle Grace Family?</strong></h3><p>Michelle Grace’s parents are Marsha and George Messer. And then there is Nicholle Messer, her sister.</p><p>Nicholle, according to her Facebook, studied in Liberal Arts Program at Columbia College of Chicago; went to Richwoods High School; studied Hair at Culver City Beauty College. Also, she seemed to be based in Mission Viejo, California.</p><p>On 11 May 2021, Michelle lost her grandmother Cecelia Ford. The elderly passed away at the age of 93 at their Dobson House in Chandler, Arizona. She was preceded in death by her husband who died in 1983.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4><strong>Where Is Michelle Grace From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Michelle Grace was based in Pacific Palisades, California as of the time of this writing.
