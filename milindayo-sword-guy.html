Up until this day, many questions are there about whether the act was real or fake. Let’s explore.</strong></p><p>Milindayo, whose real name is Arnold Gerrit Henskes, is not the usual person in the limelight.</p><p>Further, his stage name is Milin Dajo, but netizens know him by Milindayo’s name.</p><p>Milindayo was known as the Human Pincushion, who has left many people wondering about reality and imagination.</p><p>It has been years since Milindayo, or the Human Pincushion, has been in the news for his extraordinary talent.</p><p>Originally from Switzerland, Milindayo, the Sword Guy, is now popular worldwide.</p><h2>Milindayo Sword Guy: Trinity’s Sword Act That Left Audience In Shock</h2><p>The sword guy Milindayo saw his initial fame after being part of a performance group called Trinity.</p><p>The group had other famous members, like hypnotist Hylke Otter and assistant Johann de Groot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thiswastv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Milindayo-sword.jpg><p>Audiences who witnessed the performance by the group Trinity were left in shock and confusion.</p><p>Johann de Groot, who was a member of the group, would put a sword through Milindayo’s abdomen.</p><p>Naturally, a person would collapse or even die after receiving a sword in their stomach, but Milindayo was fine after the act.</p><p><strong>Not only was he fine and completely healthy, but Milindayo, the sword guy, normally walked around the stage with the sword still inside his abdomen.</strong></p><p>This abnormal act and performance were so shocking for the audiences that some were fainting, and some even had a heart attack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thiswastv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Milindayo-stage.jpg><p>After this insane reaction from the audience, the Swiss officials decided to revoke the group’s public performance.</p><p>After the act’s popularity, various other Swiss medical facilities invited Milindayo and the group for an investigation.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Nikki Howard Wikipedia, Age, Net Worth: Meet Comedian, Actress</a></p><h2>Milindayo’s Unbelievable Sword Act Raises Questions of Reality And Higher Consciousness</h2><p>What was even more shocking was that the investigation suggested that the 28-inch sword did go through Milindayo’s body.</p><p>The X-ray report also shows that it was not a trick but a real act Milindayo performed onstage.</p><p><strong>The experts found out that Milindayo’s practices were similar to various other Sufi practitioners.</strong></p><p>However, in the case of Milindayo, the sword was going through areas of his body that were extremely unsafe.</p><p>A hypothesis suggests that Milindayo was able to receive the sword on his body because of his higher consciousness.</p><p>Milindayo was living a life of fame and success after his unimaginable abilities, but it ended.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thiswastv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Milindayo-xray.jpg><p>In the year 1948, Milindayo decided to swallow a 35-centimeter metal splinter.</p><p>This time, Milindayo was not lucky enough, eventually leading him to die.</p><p>This splinter went through his sensitive organs, causing internal bleeding.</p><p>It is still shocking that Milindayo was constantly on the stage receiving swords on his body, being completely fine.</p><p><strong>However, no one up until now can verify whether all of his acts were real or fake.</strong></p><p>His final act that led to his death does give some sort of clarification about them being real, but we cannot say for sure.</p><p>Regardless, Milindayo, the sword guy, is indeed someone who was able to shock the world with his insane capabilities.</p><p><strong>You May Like:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Brittany
