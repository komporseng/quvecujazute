Los Angeles Police Department responded to a medical emergency at 1:50 PM ET. to find a dead body, later identified as Brown Jr., according to LAPD public information officer Jeff Lee. Details regarding the cause of death have remained unavailable since then. However, Bobby Br. Jr's ex-girlfriend has now revealed that she was the "love of his life," and how the pair dated for "years".</p><p>27-year-old Jennifer Tatiana dated Brown Jr on and off for around three years, and the couple even had plans of getting married. Tatiana has also claimed that she was aware of his current girlfriend 22-year-old Anna Reed. The pair were still in touch with each other, and that last October, he even confessed his love to her. She then told the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Sun</a>, that she was the "love of his life" and he even helped her to get out of drugs and an abusive relationship. Talking about his sudden death, Tatiana told <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Sun</a>, "I feel like a piece of me has been torn out. I literally feel so empty. It's like my other half is gone, and I was the love of his life. We told each other forever, and this isn't forever, it's just a wave of emotions. I'm taking it a day at a time, but I truly feel like he's still here. He has too much spirit to just leave. I'm so sad I don't get to see him live out his dreams, play sold-out arenas and follow in his dad's footsteps, and living up to that name he was so blessed to have." The couple allegedly met somewhere in 2018 through Instagram and felt an "instant connection."</p><p>She told the magazine that she was in a "short-lived abusive relationship with a man who beat her and got her into drugs, including Xanax and Percocet, an opioid."&nbsp; She says that Bobby Jr. was terrified that Tatiana will also end up like his half-sister, <a href=#>Bobbi Kristina who passed away in July 2015</a> after being in a coma for 6 months. In January 2015 she was found unconscious in her home's bathtub. Reports suggest that she was in an abusive relationship with her alleged husband, Nick Gordon. "Bobby had seen I was going down the same path as his sister, God rest her soul. Even when we weren't together he made a point like, 'I love you to death, I refuse to sit here and see my future wife go down this [route]. I won't give up until I get you out of this," Tatiana told <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Sun</a>.</p><p>"I really did almost end up dying and wound up in the hospital. At that point he was like, 'I'm not playing with this anymore, you gotta get out'. He would say, 'I already lost someone that I love so much, I can't lose someone else that I love.. The guy I was dating struggled with drug addiction and he kind of dragged me down with him, he had me there doped up on the couch next to him. I couldn't tell my friends, I was too scared. He [Bobby] was the only person I could talk to. Even when I told him [Bobby] he never judged me, he really just loved me unconditionally. It sounds crazy but Bobby really saved my life," she said while talking about how Bobby saved her from an abusive relationship and drugs.</p><p>"He wrote a song about my abusive relationship called, Say Something. He said, 'I know that this is for you, but I wanted to write it in a way that still touches the hearts of women going through what you went through.' We got back together. We had stuff we were dealing with, but we loved each other so much. "We both had moments where we were dating other people, but we talked about the end goal, getting married and having kids one day," <a href=# rel=nofollow>she told the magazine</a>.</p><p>One of seven Brown children, Bobby Brown Jr. was just 13-year-old&nbsp; when he appeared on the family's 2005 Bravo reality show, 'Being Bobby Brown,' along with his late half-sister, Bobbi Kristina Brown. Brown Jr. dropped his first music single 'Say Something' in September 2020</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJumm5qpYq%2Bzu9anZKOtnp68s3nJq2SesF2ctrO4xaugnqaUYn94ediemKtln6GxbrbEp6WinpWnerWt06KYp5ldmb%2B2s9JmmJuto57DpnnRnqOarJmku7S0yKk%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-bobby-brown-junior-jr-ex-girlfriend-27-year-old-jennifer-tatiana-drugs-abusive-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-bobby-brown-junior-jr-ex-girlfriend-27-year-old-jennifer-tatiana-drugs-abusive-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-bobby-brown-junior-jr-ex-girlfriend-27-year-old-jennifer-tatiana-drugs-abusive-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-bobby-brown-junior-jr-ex-girlfriend-27-year-old-jennifer-tatiana-drugs-abusive-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-bobby-brown-junior-jr-ex-girlfriend-27-year-old-jennifer-tatiana-drugs-abusive-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-bobby-brown-junior-jr-ex-girlfriend-27-year-old-jennifer-tatiana-drugs-abusive-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tibor-vass-and-alice-adams-murders.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tibor-vass-and-alice-adams-murders.html>Attila Ban: Unveiling the Man Behind Murders of Tibor Vass and Alice Adams</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./milindayo-sword-guy.html>Milindayo Sword Guy: Story Of Human Pincushion Real Or Fake?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./milindayo-sword-guy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
